# SportsPollApp
The "Sports Poll" app is a dead simple poll system around some sports events which can be fetched from a JSON file.
===============================================================
### Using Angular JS framework

===============================================================
### It allows user:
1. To vote on each event
2. Shows another random event on browser reload
3. Calculates the poll count

===============================================================
### Limitations:
1. As of now, the votes are generated randomly.
2. Currently there is no store for the track of votes across page reloads.
